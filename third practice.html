                        <p>Sergio Ramos continues his climb up the rankings in the world game. The Real Madrid and Spain skipper is now up into third position in the all-time international cap standings. His start in the game between Spain and Germany brought his tally to 178  and saw him draw level with Al Deayea (Arabia Saudia) and Al Mutawa (Kuwait). The only players that now lie ahead of him are 
                            Ahmed Mubarak (Oman), who earned a cap more, and Ahmed Hassan (Egypt), who holds the record after making 184 appearances.</p>

                        <h5>Laso: “The team's defense will be key in bringing down Maccabi's point-scoring"</h5>
                        <p>Pablo Laso and Sergio Llull assessed the clash with Maccabi (Wednesday, 6.30pm CET), on Euroleague match day nine. The madridista coach explained: “Playing so many games in a row has a great physical and mental impact. Playing less sees your concentration levels drop off and you're not in the best shape. That's why the Maccabi game will be a big test for us. After the break we've had because the MoraBanc Andorra was got postponed, we're up against tough opposition with good point-scorers in every position”.</p>

                        <h5>Status of Santiago Bernabéu Stadium renovation work</h5>
                        <p>The Santiago Bernabéu of the 21st century is set to be a major state-of-the-art, universal icon and, since June 2019, a stunning transformation has been taking place. Some of the work that reflects this change relates to the roof, where the north and south stand sections have now been dismantled. In addition, the extendible section of the roof on the side of the stadium that runs along the Castellana has also been removed, along with other parts. In the future, the new roof's fixed structure will protect all of the stadium's seats, whilst the retractable roof will cover all of the pitch.</p>
